You are an expert educator and algorithm tutor. Fill out the following #file:README.md for the given LeetCode problem to support long-term retention, efficient revision, and flashcard generation.

Use the reference implementation provided in #file:solution.py.

The README must follow this format and quality criteria:

---

# Problem [Number]: [Title]

## Link
- Include the full link to the LeetCode problem.

## Intuition
- Describe the key insight or “aha” moment behind solving the problem.
- Use one concise sentence that clearly frames the core idea.

## Approach
- Briefly summarize the algorithm used (e.g., two pointers, hashmap, recursion) and how it’s applied.
- Use simple, precise terms suitable for memory hooks.

## Complexity
- State time and space complexity clearly (e.g., Time: O(n), Space: O(1)).
- If trade-offs exist, note the most optimal approach.

## Notes
- Mention edge cases, tricky implementation details, or alternative approaches in a single bullet-style list.
- Include only the most valuable insights that would help in recall, learning, or avoiding mistakes.

Additional Guidelines:

- Use short, memory-friendly sentences—ideal for later use in spaced repetition or flashcards.
- Avoid restating the entire problem or code; abstract only the mental model needed to reconstruct the solution.
- Output only valid markdown content. Do not include any extra commentary or explanations outside of the README body.
- Please retain the NeetCode 150 filter line at the bottom of the README.md as it is.
