You are an expert educator specializing in creating effective Anki flashcards for deep learning and long-term retention.

Given the following LeetCode problem README and Python solution code, generate multiple Anki flashcards designed to help deeply understand and remember the problem-solving approach.

README: #file:README.md  
Solution: #file:solution.py

Requirements:

- Cover these key areas:  
  - Core concepts and underlying theory  
  - Problem-solving patterns or algorithms involved  
  - Edge cases and constraints to watch for  
  - Step-by-step breakdown of how the solution works (and why)  
  - Common mistakes or misconceptions to avoid  
  - Analogies, metaphors, or intuitive explanations (when helpful)

- Apply evidence-based learning techniques such as:  
  - **Active recall**: phrase clear, focused questions on the front  
  - **Spaced repetition**: use concise, focused information per card  
  - **Cloze deletions** (e.g., {{c1::like this}}) for key ideas, steps, or terms  
  - **Elaboration**: encourage explanations over memorization  
  - **Interleaving**: if applicable, relate to similar problems or concepts

- Keep each card:  
  - Focused on a single concept, idea, or step  
  - In a format suitable for spaced repetition (Anki)  
  - Concise, clear, and easily reviewable

- Use a **variety of card types**:  
  - Direct Q&A  
  - Fill-in-the-blank  
  - True/False or multiple-choice style  
  - Cloze deletions for definitions, code logic, edge cases, etc.

- Each card should have these fields:  
  - **front**: The question or prompt, beginning with the problem identifier in the format:  
    `[ProblemNumber] Problem Title - `  
    (e.g., `[0019] Remove Nth Node From End Of List - Why use a dummy node?`)  
  - **back**: The detailed answer or explanation, including cloze deletions where appropriate  
  - **tags**: A list of space-separated keywords inferred from the README and solution, e.g., `linked-list two-pointers edge-case`  
  - **card_type**: One of `"basic"` or `"cloze"` indicating the type of Anki card

If this problem is part of NeetCode 150, **add the tag `NeetCode150`** to each card's `tags` field.

- Output the result as a **single valid JSON object** with these top-level fields:  
  - `"problem_id"`: The problem number as string, e.g., `"0019"`  
  - `"problem_title"`: The problem title as string  
  - `"cards"`: A list of card objects as described above

- The output JSON should be saved directly as a **`cards.json`** file corresponding to the problem.

- Do NOT output any other commentary or markdown â€” output only the JSON content.

Example output snippet (not full):

{
  "problem_id": "0019",
  "problem_title": "Remove Nth Node From End Of List",
  "cards": [
    {
      "front": "[0019] Remove Nth Node From End Of List - What is the main algorithmic pattern used to solve this problem in one pass?",
      "back": "The {{c1::two-pointers}} technique, where two pointers are kept n+1 apart to identify the node to remove in a single traversal.",
      "tags": "linked-list two-pointers algorithm",
      "card_type": "cloze"
    },
    {
      "front": "[0019] Remove Nth Node From End Of List - True/False: This approach works for single-node lists.",
      "back": "True; the dummy node handles these edge cases.",
      "tags": "linked-list edge-case",
      "card_type": "basic"
    }
  ]
}
